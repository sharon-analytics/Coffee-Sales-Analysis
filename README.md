## Project Overview

☕ This project delivers an end-to-end sales analysis of a coffee shop using transaction data sourced from Maven Analytics. The goal is to uncover actionable business insights such as peak sales periods, best-selling items, category performance, and customer behavior patterns.

📊 All work was done in **Excel**, including cleaning, transformation, and dashboard visualization. This project is ideal for stakeholders seeking to improve sales, optimize inventory, and tailor marketing efforts.

## Data Cleaning 

🧹 I started by thoroughly checking and refining (if needed) the dataset:
- ✅ Checked for duplicates and corrected formatting inconsistencies
- ✅ Verified numerical data types and date-time formatting
- ✅ Standardized product and category names for grouping accuracy

🧠 Then, I enhanced the dataset with the following derived fields:
- **Hour of Sale**: Extracted from time to identify rush hours
- **Day of Week**: For analyzing weekly patterns
- **Sales Period**: Grouped time into periods (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- **Revenue per Product/Category**: Calculated fields for performance comparison

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here are some key business questions that guided the analysis:

- 🏆 Which products and categories are generating the most revenue?
- 🛍️ What are the most frequently purchased items?
- ⏰ What time of day sees the highest volume of sales?
- 📅 Are there specific days with significantly higher or lower activity?
- 💡 Which low-performing items might need promotion or removal?

---

## Insights & Findings

- 🔝 **Top Performing Items**: Coffee, Espresso, and Latte were the most sold and highest in revenue.
- 💵 **Highest Revenue Category**: Beverages dominated both quantity and total earnings.
- 🕒 **Sales Peaks**: Customer traffic peaked between **8 AM – 11 AM** (morning rush).
- 🌇 **Slowest Periods**: Sales dropped significantly during **2 PM – 4 PM**.
- 📆 **Top Day**: **Friday** recorded the highest sales volume.
- 💤 **Slowest Day**: **Sunday** had the least activity.
- 🥐 **Pairing Opportunities**: Customers frequently purchase bakery items alongside drinks—suggesting strong upselling potential.

---

## Recommendations

📈 **Targeted Promotions**
- Launch **Morning Combos** (e.g., “Coffee + Croissant”) during **8–11 AM**
- Run **Afternoon Boosters** during **slow hours (2–4 PM)** with discounted pastries or drinks

📦 **Inventory Optimization**
- Stock up on high-demand products early in the week for Friday demand
- Monitor low-selling items for potential removal or bundling

🎯 **Marketing Ideas**
- Implement **“Buy 9, Get 1 Free”** loyalty programs for coffee lovers
- Highlight bakery add-ons during checkout or via signage
